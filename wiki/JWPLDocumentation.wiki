#summary Starting page for the JWPL Documentation.

== Is JWPL for you? ==

JWPL is for you:
 * If you need structured access to Wikipedia in Java.

JWPL is not for you:
 * If you need to query live data. JWPL works on an optimized database, i.e. you are querying a static Wikipedia dump. This gives much better performance and lightens the load on the Wikipedia servers.

== Documentation ==
  * Documentation for [JWPL_Core JWPL Core]
  * Documentation for the [WikipediaRevisionToolkit Wikipedia Revision Toolkit]
  * Developer Setup: [DeveloperSetup Setting up Maven and Eclipse for JWPL development]

== Support ==
If you have any technical questions, please write to the [http://groups.google.com/group/jwpl JWPL Mailing List].

== Preprocessed Dumps ==
A preprocessed JWPL dump of the English Wikipedia (articles and talk pages) including revisions can be made available upon request. The current package was created from the wiki_en_20110405 wikipedia dump.

The total size of all sql and data files is about 66GB (bz2).<br/>
The size of the resulting database is about 158GB (126GB for the data and 32GB for the indexes).

== Is JWPL for you? ==

JWPL is for you:
 * If you need structured access to Wikipedia in Java.

JWPL is not for you:
 * If you need to query live data. JWPL works on an optimized database, i.e. you are querying a static Wikipedia dump. This gives much better performance and lightens the load on the Wikipedia servers.

If you have any technical questions, please write to the [http://groups.google.com/group/jwpl JWPL Mailing List].

== Description == 

Lately, Wikipedia has been recognized as a promising lexical semantic resource. If Wikipedia is to be used for large-scale NLP tasks, efficient programmatic access to the knowledge therein is required.
The high-performance Wikipedia API provides structured access to information nuggets like redirects, categories, articles and link structure.
JWPL contains a Mediawiki Markup parser that can be used to further analyze the contents of a Wikipedia page. The parser can also be used stand-alone with other texts using !MediaWiki markup.
Further, JWPL contains the tool JWPLDataMachine that can be used to create JWPL dumps from the publicly available dumps at http://download.wikimedia.org.

In addition to that, JWPL now contains the _Wikipedia Revision Toolkit_, which consists of two tools, the _!TimeMachine_ and the _!RevisionMachine_. The !TimeMachine can be used to reconstruct a snapshot of Wikipedia from a specific date, or to create multiple snapshots from a time span. The !RevisionMachine offers efficient access to the edit history of Wikipedia articles while storing the revisions in a dedicated storage format which decreases the demand of storage space by 98%.

== Is JWPL for you? ==

JWPL is for you:
 * If you need structured access to Wikipedia in Java.

JWPL is not for you:
 * If you need to query live data. JWPL works on an optimized database, i.e. you are querying a static Wikipedia dump. This gives much better performance and lightens the load on the Wikipedia servers.

== Documentation ==
  * Documentation for [JWPL_Core JWPL Core]
  * Documentation for the [WikipediaRevisionToolkit Wikipedia Revision Toolkit]
  * Developer Setup: [DeveloperSetup Setting up Maven and Eclipse for JWPL development]

== Support ==
If you have any technical questions, please write to the [http://groups.google.com/group/jwpl JWPL Mailing List].

== Preprocessed Dumps ==
A preprocessed JWPL dump of the English Wikipedia (articles and talk pages) including revisions can be made available upon request. The current package was created from the wiki_en_20110405 wikipedia dump.

The total size of all sql and data files is about 66GB (bz2).<br/>
The size of the resulting database is about 158GB (126GB for the data and 32GB for the indexes).

== Overview Poster ==
For a first overview over the JWPL components, have a look at the ACL 2011 poster. Its main focus is the Wikipedia Revision Toolkit, but it also contains some information about JWPL Core.

#summary Starting page for the JWPL Documentation.

== Is JWPL for you? ==

JWPL is for you:
 * If you need structured access to Wikipedia in Java.

JWPL is not for you:
 * If you need to query live data. JWPL works on an optimized database, i.e. you are querying a static Wikipedia dump. This gives much better performance and lightens the load on the Wikipedia servers.

== Documentation ==
  * Documentation for [JWPL_Core JWPL Core]
  * Documentation for the [WikipediaRevisionToolkit Wikipedia Revision Toolkit]
  * [DeveloperSetup Developer Setup: Setting up Maven and Eclipse for JWPL development]

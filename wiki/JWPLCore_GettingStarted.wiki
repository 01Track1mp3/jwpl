== Getting Started ==
   # Create the JWPL database(s) using the DataMachine or TimeMachine.
      * Use the DataMachine, if you just need a single database from a certain date.
      * Use the TimeMachine to create multiple Wikipedia databases corresponding to past states of Wikipedia 
   # Checkout the source code from the [http://code.google.com/p/jwpl/source/checkout SVN] and build it using Maven.
      * You may also use the pre-packaged .jars from the [http://code.google.com/p/jwpl/downloads/list download section], but those will not contain recent improvements and bug fixes.
   # Follow the examples in the [JwplTutorial tutorial]. The tutorials are also included in the source code and the archives.
   # If you encounter any problems, please also check the [JWPL_FAQ FAQ].
